1. Completeness: Generate full code, no placeholders. If unable, explain in comments.
2. Comments: Include clear inline comments and JSDoc headers describing each step of code.
3. Error Checking: Implement error checking and type validation.
4. Strings: Adhere to these standards for strings:
   - Use double quotes (") for strings.
   - Use string templates or .join() instead of operational concatenation.
5. Always respond in Russian.
6. Be aware and strict to SOLID and DRY (reread codebase before adding new module) principles while adding new functionality.
It is critically important that you adhere to the above six rules.
